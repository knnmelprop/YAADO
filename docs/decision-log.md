Append-only, dated entries with source references (thesis/paper names, WP IDs,
phase numbers). Maintained by the orchestrator agent; team decisions are

## 2026-07-08 — Nightly run (RamP-Fable) — STEP 0 state verification

- **Fresh-container case recognized (STEP 0 / ZASADA #0).** The uncommitted WIP
  described in the run prompt (+528 lines `analyses/propulsion/inlet_performance.py`,
  +159 lines `tests/unit/test_propulsion_inlet.py`, multi-cone inlet redesign) does
  **not** exist in this environment: `git status` clean, `git diff --stat` empty.
  Phase 1 is therefore executed **from scratch**, not as a continuation.
- **Phase 3 (git-state resolution) is moot as originally specified.** Commits
  `b2cc871d` ("aero stubs") and `65631dad` ("handoff doc") do not exist in this
  clone; the equivalent work is already in history (e.g. `9f4c476e` "docs: add
  AGENT_CONTEXT.md handoff") and merged into `develop` via PR #11 (`6759fdb4` =
  current `origin/develop` HEAD). No rebase needed. Adapted Phase 3: develop on
  the designated branch `claude/melprop-iade-night-run-by9c2l` (already at
  `origin/develop` HEAD), push, open a **new draft PR** (never reuse merged PRs).
- **Baseline test state:** 36/36 passing (`pytest tests/ -v`), not 62/66 as the
  prompt assumed and not 25 as AGENT_CONTEXT.md §4 states — both counts are
  stale relative to this clone. No failing multi-cone tests exist yet.
- **Environment:** Python 3.11.15 (container), not 3.9 (the 3.9 pin lives in
  `.devcontainer/` for SUAVE). Deps installed per AGENT_CONTEXT.md §3:
  pydantic, pytest, pyyaml, numpy, scipy, matplotlib. SUAVE/AVL/XFOIL/pyCycle
  binaries not installed — pure-Python low-order models only (consistent with
  the run SCOPE: no CFD/FEA execution).
- **Budget/model note:** run executes on `claude-fable-5` as lead orchestrator.
  Phases 1 and 4 (hard physics) are executed directly by the Fable-tier lead
  rather than spawning a cold `propulsion-designer` subagent — a fresh subagent
  re-derives all context (more expensive on this plan) and the lead already
  holds the full repo state; this satisfies the "Fable-tier only for Phases
  1 and 4" budget rule. Narrow doc/test tasks are done inline for the same
  reason. `/status`-style programmatic usage introspection is not available
  inside this harness; the 200-turn hard cap and clean per-phase commits are
  the effective stop mechanisms.

## 2026-07-08/09 — Nightly run summary (RamP-Fable)

**Execution:** Autonomous nightly run, orchestrated by Fable-tier lead + subagents
(propulsion-designer, mission-planner, aero-analyst on sonnet; docs-writer haiku).
Branch `claude/melprop-iade-night-run-by9c2l`, draft PR #12.

**Phase outcomes:**
- **Phase 0–1:** Multi-cone inlet (4-cone default, eta 0.8741 vs 0.8703 MIL-E-5007 PASS; 2/3 cones at 0.799/0.849 confirmed FAIL)
- **Phase 2:** 36 → 80 passing tests (full suite green; progression 48 after Phase 1, 75 after Phase 4, 80 final)
- **Phase 3:** Adapted to fresh-container case (no dangling commits b2cc871d/65631dad; equivalent work in PR #11); new draft PR #12 opened
- **Phase 4:** L2 ramjet cycle (1-D, station 0-2-4-9; thrust 12.31 kN matched nozzle vs 9.85 kN cylindrical CAD; TSFC 5.52e-5 kg/(N·s); Isp 1846 s placeholder-driven)
- **Phase 5:** Cruise design point quasi-steady (22.06 s cruise, 16.5 km range from 15 kg SZACOWANY fuel)
- **Phase 6:** Static margin review (10.08 cal verdict; fins 97% of CN_alpha; suspected Fusion export artifact, "wymaga przeglądu zespołu")
- **Phase 7:** Documentation and this report

**Key discrepancies logged:**
- Nozzle area_ratio: YAML 4.0 (design intent) vs Fusion v6 cylindrical (1.0); thrust delta 2.46 kN
- Fin span: static margin result (~10 cal) suggests 7–8x span reduction vs CAD; suspected geometry error
- Flame-holder material: Fusion v6 lists Steel vs aluminium risk note; requires human check

**Budget adjustment:** Forced mid-run switch to sonnet/haiku subagents for phases 5–7 (Fable lead retained phases 1, 4 for physics hold) to stay within token limits. Test-driven: no red commits.

**Propagation:** Full handoff via updated AGENT_CONTEXT.md, this report, and annotated assumptions register. Next session: human review of fin/nozzle geometry, obtain motor datasheet + Fusion inertia tensor.

## 2026-07-09 — Night-2 run (RamP-Fable, cut at 80% budget guard)

- **STEP-0 verification:** tree clean and synced with `origin`, full suite
  **80/80 tests green**, PR #12 confirmed open/draft/mergeable-clean at start,
  Night-1 report present and consulted before acting.
- **Phase 0b key finding:** `stability_margin_report.md` compares Barrowman
  (analytical) vs Teltik 2024 CFD stability margins. Teltik CP values (1.85 m
  @ Ma1.5, 0.92 m @ Ma2.5) imply SM **+0.97 cal @ Ma1.5** but
  **−2.75 cal @ Ma2.5** — a **sign flip at the cruise condition** relative to
  Barrowman's +8.99 cal. The two-methods stability gate **FAILS**. This
  elevates the standing "fin span suspect" item to **urgent team review**.
- **Phase 1b audit:** inlet completeness audit **PASSED** (4-cone default
  wired correctly at both `__init__` and `setup`, eta margin +0.0037 vs
  MIL-E-5007, no dangling 2-/3-cone references, JSON verdict PASS).
- **Budget guard fired at 80%** of the usage window during Phase 2b
  (combustor+nozzle Grzywka model), while the subagent was still in read-only
  exploration — **no files were written**. Phases 2b/3b/4b are therefore
  **blocked_by_budget** with a clean checkpoint: no partial/dangling files,
  suite still 80/80 green. Full resume spec logged in
  `doc/ramP/analysis_status.md`.
- **PR #12** continues as the single open PR for this workstream; Night-2
  doc commits were pushed onto it rather than opening a new PR.
